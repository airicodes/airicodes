### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm Jeremie! Currently studying Software Engineering and I am interested in many fields of computer science (favourite one has to be Networking!).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Robotics and more specifically coding its mechanical and electrical aspects

- I've got many projects currently set as private due to the type of work done but would love to talk to you about them!
